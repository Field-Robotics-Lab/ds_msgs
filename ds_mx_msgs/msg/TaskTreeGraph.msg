# The TaskTree Graph encodes the TaskTree as a Graph (discrete mathematics sense) with
# Vertices representing Tasks and Edges representing a parent Task / SubTask relationship.


# Vertices represent individual tasks
TaskTreeVertex[] vertices

# Edges encode parent/subtask relationships
TaskTreeEdge[] edges
